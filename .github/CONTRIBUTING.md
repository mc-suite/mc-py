## Your First Contribution

### Unsure where to begin contributing to cdQA?

You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

### Working on your first Pull Request?

Here are some example steps to get it done:

- Fork the project from `master` branch with the name of the issue you want to fix.
- Commit to your fork until your fix is done.
- Open a pull request in order to merge your fork with the `master`.
- Discuss with peers and update your code until pull request is accepted by repository admins.
- Synchonise your repository with the latest `master` changes.
- Repeat!
